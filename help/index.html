        <h1>Password Manager Generator</h1>

        <p>To generate strong passwords there are several methods. We can use for example 
        a <a href="http://keepass.info/">encrypted databases as KeepPass</a>. Or we can also use
        <a href="http://pasmangen-extension.github.io/">PMG, another method for generating 
        strong passwords</a>. Now we will explain its characteristics, how it works, and how to use it.</p>

        <h2>How PMG works?</h2>

        <p>PMG use the domain, the user name and a master password <strong>to generate
        a hash to use as the password</strong> for your account. May be this is not understood very well,
        but using the application is best way to understand how PMG works.
                
        <h2>How to use PMG?</h2>
        
        <p>PMG is quite simple. The first screen asks you to enter the <strong>account name</strong>
        (for example: twitter, gmail, etc.) and the <strong>user name</strong> (for example: chemaalonso, 
        hackathonlovers, etc.). So you can have differents users on the same service.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="./img/pmg-02-cuenta-y-usuario.png"
                 alt="Homepage where you have to enter the account name and the user name" />
            <figcaption>Figure 1: Homepage where you have to enter the account name and the user name</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The account name and the user name are stored in the <strong>Navigator Local Storage</strong>,
        so in the future an <strong>autocomplete menu appears</strong> with the data and we have to write less and we can go faster.</p>

        <p>After filling the data, we click on the <strong>"Calculate Coordinate"</strong> button
        and then we have another screen where you have to enter a <strong>code from a codes card</strong>
        and a <strong>master password</strong>.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="./img/pmg-05-codigo-y-password.png"
                 alt="Second step where you have to enter a code from a codes card and a master password" />
            <figcaption>Figure 2: Second step where you have to enter a code from a codes card and a master password</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The coordinate (in this case the coordinate 39) will always be the same for
        the tuple account name and user name. Indeed the coordinate is calculated normalizing the text,
        adding the numerical value of each character and dividing by the number of coordinates of the card,
        as shown in the following sample code:</p>

        <figure>
            <pre><code>var account     = normalizeText( $('#account').val() );
var user        = normalizeText( $('#user').val() );
var data        = account + user;
var dataCode    = sumCharCode( data );
var coordenate  = dataCode % CODES_CARD_CELLS;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Figure 3: Code to extract coordinate from the account name and user name</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The code of the codes card is not required to put it, although it advisable to increase security.
        A little below explain <a href="#crear-tarjeta-coordenadas">how to create our own codes card</a>.</p>

        <p>Both, <strong>the code from your codes card</strong> and <strong>your master password</strong>
        can be entered using a virtual keyboard to avoid keyloggers and further increase security.</p>
        
        <p>After entering all the data, the generated password is displayed. We can't see it at first,
        so you have to select it to view and to copy it.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="./img/pmg-07-copiar-password.png"
                 alt="Last step where you select and copy the generated password" />
            <figcaption>Figure 4: Last step where you select and copy the generated password</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The generated password will always be the same for the same:
        account name, user name, code of the codes card and master password. It is the hash of the data set.
        It can be seen in the following sample code:</p>

        <figure>
            <pre><code>var account             = $('#account').val();
var user                = $('#user').val();
var password            = $('#password').val();
var code                = $('#code').val();
var data                = normalizeText( account + user ) + code + password;
var hash                = hashWrapper( data );
var generatedPassword   = hash.substr( 0, GENERATED_PASSWORD_LENGTH );</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Figura 5: Code to generate the password</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2><a name="crear-tarjeta-coordenadas">How to create your own codes card?</a></h2>

        <p>As we said before, although not mandatory, to increase security, PMG ask us a code from a codes card.
        If we want to use this feature, we must to have a <strong>codes card</strong> before starting using PMG.
        Fortunately PMG lets you create your own. To do this we click on <strong>"Generate Your Card Codes"</strong>
        and shows a screen where we have to fill some data.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="./img/pmg-09-semillas-tarjeta.png"
                 alt="Data to generate your codes card" />
            <figcaption>Figure 6: Data to generate your codes card</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>These data include: your <strong>place of birth</strong>, 
        the <strong>name of your best childhood friend</strong>, the <strong>name of your primary school</strong>.
        All these date can be obtained through
        <a href="http://www.elladodelmal.com/2013/06/un-pequeno-juego-de-ingenieria-social.html">social engineering</a>,
        so we have to introduce also one more field that is the <strong>name of your codes card</strong>,
        which should be completely secret. Once the fields are filled, if we click on the
        <strong>"Generate Codes Card"</strong> button and get a codes card like this, that we can print:</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="./img/pmg-10-tarjeta-de-coordenadas.png"
                 alt="Generated codes card" />
            <figcaption>Figure 6: Generated codes card</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>For the same input data, we always obtain the same codes card, because it's the hash of the data,
        as can be seen in the following code sample:</p>

        <figure>
            <pre><code>var birthplace      = normalizeText( $('#birthplace').val() );
var childhoodFriend = normalizeText( $('#childhoodFriend').val() );
var schoolName      = normalizeText( $('#schoolName').val() );
var cardName        = normalizeText( $('#cardName').val() );

var data1   = birthplace + childhoodFriend + schoolName + cardName;
var data2   = schoolName + cardName + birthplace + childhoodFriend;
var hash    = hashWrapper(data1) + hashWrapper(data2);</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Figure 7: Code to generate the codes card</figcaption>
        </figure>
